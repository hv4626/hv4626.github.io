Hi, HV this side, or call me Harshvardhan
This is my homepage or website, whatever, a hobby project to let me pass the time when I was bored in my final semester at IITB.
I learned HTML CSS when I was in Std X and XII as part of my CBSE curriculum. It was rote learning at that time, but now I am doing it as a hobby.
I am particularly drawn toward old websites, especially social media like old FB, Orkut or Google+ because of that simplicity; hence it was my attempt to recreate that over a lonely weekend.
This is replica(try-hard attempt) from the early 2004 facebook webpage
